# RR-Notifier
A Firefox extension to notify when there are new chapters in your RoyalRoad Follow List

### Current capabilities
* Shows unread count on toolbar icon. Shows number of fictions with unread chapters, not total unread chapters.
* Drop-down menu (left-click on toolbar button) shows a list of latest unread chapters, with links.
* Periodical check for new chapters every 10 minutes (not configrable yet) as well as manual check.
* Should be logged in to RoyalRoad in-browser for it to work.
